PART 3

Overview

This phase of the project focuses on enhancing the website’s functionality, usability, and visibility.
The improvements include adding JavaScript-based interactivity, implementing form validation, improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and ensuring mobile responsiveness.
All code was tested across multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent functionality and accessibility.

Note on Part 2

No major improvements or revisions were made to Part 2 because the website already met all requirements and achieved full marks.

The structure, layout, and design from Part 2 were retained as they aligned with the assessment rubric and functioned correctly across all devices.

Part 3 therefore focuses entirely on enhancing interactivity, functionality, and SEO, while maintaining the original high-quality foundation established in Part 2.

Website Goals – Part 3

The main goals for Part 3 were to enhance functionality, improve user engagement, and increase online visibility through technical and visual upgrades.
These goals focused on improving both user experience (UX) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) while maintaining consistent branding and accessibility across all pages.

Key Goals:

To make the website more interactive and engaging through JavaScript functionality (modals, accordions, search filters).

To improve discoverability and ranking performance on search engines through structured on-page and off-page SEO techniques.

To ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility across different devices and browsers.

To validate and secure all form submissions using client-side JavaScript validation.

To increase performance and loading speed through optimization and lazy loading.

To improve website maintainability with modular JavaScript and clean, reusable CSS.

To ensure search engines can easily index the website using robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.

Enhancements Implemented (Functionality and SEO)

- JavaScript interactive features:
  - Added dynamic content loader for a `featured-products` section on `index.html`.
  - Implemented product search + category filter + new sorting (Name/Price) in `products.html` with `js/search.js`.
  - Added smooth scroll-in animations and a Back-to-Top control (already present in Part 2, refined).
  - Integrated Lightbox gallery for product images (Part 3 requirement: gallery/lightbox).

- Interactive Map (Leaflet):
  - Store marker, Locate Me, Get Directions, Reset Map.
  - Distance calculation and simple route visualization using polylines.

- Forms and Validation:
  - Client-side validation via `js/forms.js` applied to `enquiryForm`, `contactForm`, `newsletterForm`.
  - Converted forms to AJAX submission using `makeRequest(...)` helper.
  - Set explicit form action URLs (`https://httpbin.org/post`) for demo submission.
  - On successful enquiry, render a structured Enquiry Summary with basic availability response and a `mailto:` fallback.

- SEO (On-page & Additional Requests):
  - Added meta description/keywords to `about.html`.
  - Ensured descriptive alt text for images on products page.
  - Corrected `sitemap.xml` XML namespace and set `robots.txt` to reference `/sitemap.xml`.
 
  How Part 3 Improves the Website from Part 2

Part 2 primarily focused on structure, layout, and static content, ensuring that the website met design and usability standards.
Part 3 builds upon that foundation by integrating advanced functionality, interactivity, and optimization features.

Improvements Over Part 2:

Interactivity Added:
JavaScript introduces dynamic elements such as modals, accordions, and product search — creating a more engaging browsing experience.

Form Validation Introduced:
Contact and enquiry forms now include real-time validation with custom error messages, ensuring data accuracy and user feedback.

SEO Optimization:

CSS and JS were optimized for faster loading, and ARIA labels were added to support assistive technologies.

Mobile Optimization:
Enhanced responsive design ensures consistent usability across devices, improving mobile user satisfaction.

Dynamic Content Loading:
Products and key sections now load dynamically, allowing easier updates and scalability for future expansion.

Professional Standards:
Addition of robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and social metadata elevates the project to professional web development standards.
